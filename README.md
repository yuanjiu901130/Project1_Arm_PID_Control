# Project 1: 2-DOF Robotic Arm with PID Control

This project implements a joint-space PID control for a 2-DOF planar robotic arm using MATLAB and Simulink.

## 🔍 Objective

Demonstrate how classical PID controllers can be used to control a nonlinear robotic arm system, including:
- Kinematic and dynamic modeling
- PID controller design
- Trajectory tracking simulation

## 🧠 Background

This project builds on the author's previous theoretical work in robotic arm modeling and control. The goal is to transition from mathematical derivation to an engineering-level simulation and control implementation.
